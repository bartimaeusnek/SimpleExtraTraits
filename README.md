A simple XML mod, that adds 3 more traits:

-Insane:
Boots fighting power by a lot, +8 melee, +6 ranged, 1/2 the aiming time, +6accuracy on ranged, but creates random berserk breakdowns.

-Too Dumb:
This trait let the RimWorlder take 1.5x the time for learing a job, but his mental breakdown chance is reduced by 50%. It also disables Intellectual, ManualSkilled and Crafting tasks.

-Dumb:
Basically the same trait as "Too Dumb", but with 1.33x and 25%.
